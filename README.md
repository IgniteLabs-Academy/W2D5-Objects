# Week 2 - Day 5: Objects & Object Manipulation (Auto-Graded)

## ðŸ§  Real-World Scenario
You're managing user profiles and need to store and update user details in a JavaScript object.

## ðŸŽ¯ Assignment Tasks
1. Declare an object named `user` with properties: `name` and `age`.
2. Access and print the `name` property.
3. Update the `age` property.
4. Add a new property `email` dynamically.
5. Delete the `email` property from the object.
6. Add a nested object property `address` with keys: `city` and `country`.
7. Use object destructuring to extract `name` and `age` from the `user` object and print them.
8. Use the spread operator to create a new object `updatedUser` that copies all properties from `user` and updates the `age` to a new value.
9. Loop through all properties of the `user` object using `for...in` and print each key and value.
10. Log the complete `user` object using `console.log`.
